title: Re-scheduling my sponsored ride
---
So last nights announcement by Boris of Thursdays national lockdown has probably scuppered our chance of re-scheduling the sponsored bike ride for next weekend. Instead I think Dean and I have agreed that we will both do a solo ride in our local area on Wednesday this week. I have planned a route on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com) of around [112km which goes from home, out to Ellesmere Lakes (not Ellesmere Port) and back](https://www.komoot.com/tour/279295072). The weather is currently expected to be ok but I will aim to do it regardless as I would be embarrased to re-arrange yet again.
