[Todays featured Mac Setup](http://www.hadasycuscus.com/un-espacio-de-trabajo-en-casa-nordico-25-aniversario-leroy-merlin/?utm_source=feedly&utm_reader=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=un-espacio-de-trabajo-en-casa-nordico-25-aniversario-leroy-merlin) is another simple minimalist style workspace in a Nordic style and comes complete with instructions on how to Do It Yourself ! The slight downside is that the page is in Spanish but thanks to the magic of Google Translate anyone interested in following the guide shouldn't have too much difficulty converting to English ( or your preferred language ).
