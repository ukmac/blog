I love the look and the idea of floating desks but wonder about the practicality ? First of all there has to be a fairly robust bracket to hold the potential weight without support from below. Then what about power ? Presumably to maintain the minimal look sockets would have to be embedded at the desktop level somehow ?

Still, very pretty to look at....
