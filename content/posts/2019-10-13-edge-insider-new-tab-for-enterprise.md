The latest Edge Insider release includes a new feature for users to configure the default new tab to include the Recommended and Recent sections from the default Office.com landing page.

This is a nice addition and will be a great way of giving staff quick and easy access to their Office files without having to specifically navigate to the Office home page. The new tab page also provides a Search box that defaults to searching the users Office 365 tenant ( Sharepoint sites etc ) as well as the web.

Now if Microsoft would just switch on synching in Edge Insider for macOS I would be a very happy bunny...
