If you look at most of the images in my 
[Mac Setups section](http://ukmac.net/category/macsetups/) one thing you will probably have spotted is a distinct lack of cables. The reality of a modern gadget lovers desk is that obtaining this completely minimal look is virtually impossible, even the most stripped down setups need at least a power lead.

I have tried cable trays, sticky back ties, zip ties, blu-tack, insulating tape to name a few and generally end up re-cabling on a fairly regular basis to try to keep things neat and tidy.

The 
[Cablox Cable Organiser](http://fancy.com/things/642671243387994908/Cablox-Cable-Organizer) from fancy.com certainly looks like an interesting solution to the problem of under the desk wiring spaghetti. Just checking the fancy.com this product is currently out of stock so I can't order to check it out.

If anyone has tried this please drop a comment with your thoughts, alternatively if you know of an equivalent type of solution please let me know.
