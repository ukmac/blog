title: WhatsApp forcing users to share data with Facebook ! Bye !
---
I've been debating dropping Whatsapp and [this announcement](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/) is definitely pushing me to make the move !

UPDATE: So it takes an insurrection to finally kick Facebook and Twitter into action to do what they should have done months ( if not years ) ago !
