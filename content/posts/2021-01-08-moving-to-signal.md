title: Moving to Signal
---
So you make the decision to abandon Whatsapp and want to move to Signal, but how do you convince family and friends (who perhaps aren't as concerned about Facebooks control of the Internet as you) to move with you ?

Anyone have any convincing arguments that they have made to encourage their friends ?
