[This blog article](https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/) on the [Signal](https://signal.org) web site is fascinating and well worth a read. I find it a little hard to believe that [Moxie Marlinspike](https://github.com/moxie0) just happened to come across a Cellebrite toolbox complete with the latest version of their software that just happened to have "fallen off the back of a lorry" but for the purposes of the article can let that go ;)

What is amazing to me is that a company whose entire existence depends on finding and using flaws in other companies software have engineered their own product so poorly. It will be interesting to see how this story develops, in particular will Apple take up the issue of their code being used in Cellebrite's product ? Also, what will the files that Signal will be placing in in-app storage do (doesn't take too much imagination to guess there!) ?

Will be watching for updates on this one...
