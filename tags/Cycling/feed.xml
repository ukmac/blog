&lt;p>A belated Happy Christmas greeting to anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this blog, hope yours went as well as could be given the world in which we find ourselves. For my part Christmas was quiet and fairly relaxed and as usual over quicker than you can imagine. The actual day this year did feel quite &amp;ldquo;christmassy&amp;rdquo; due to the morning frost and clear blue sky which was really nice. Today on the first Boxing Day of 2020 (the second official one is on Monday) was slightly less so although it did manage to stay dry here in Telford until after dark. Tonight we are in for a bit of a storm as Storm Bella makes her way across the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to get out on my bike this afternoon for a quick 25k before dark which was nice especially as the roads were really quiet (almost like being back in the first lockdown again). My route tonight didnt take wind direction into account though so after an quick assisted outbound ride the return was a little slower as I battled into the early part of Storm Bella.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Earlier in the year long before lockdown (that seems such a long time ago now) one of my co-workers at &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.camphillvillagetrust.org.uk"
>The Camphill Village Trust&lt;/a> asked if I would be interested in doing a sponsored bike ride for the charities 65th anniversary which is this year. I was of course up for it and we originally planned on an early Summer event riding from our offices in Stourbridge to one of our sites in Gloucestershire (Taurus Crafts) which was coincidentally 65 miles away (105k).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after making these preliminary plans we went into the first national lockdown and the plans got parked for another day. Yesterday we finally managed to fit the ride in and so far have raised over Â£1000 as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ride we undertook was planned on Komoot and is &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/279396580"
>available here&lt;/a> if anyone is interested. Our full Strava recording is &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4285459080"
>here&lt;/a>. No records broken as you can see, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the point of the day and we did enjoy a glorious crisp and sunny autumn morning (although the afternoon wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as favourable).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I took a break from Zwift and headed out early to do a ride round the lanes near to home. I had planned a 50 loop on Komoot parts of which we familiar to me but a few bits that were new. The new bits turned out to include a couple of short off road sections, the first of which was easy enough, but the second not so much. After taking a left onto a farm track at Howle and riding about 1km up a steady hill the track just disappeared into a mass of hedgerow, nettles and brambles. Despite my best efforts and the fact that I could hear the road that I was trying to get to behind the fields to my right, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way through and ended up re-tracing my steps down the track and back onto the main road. I suppose this is part of the risk with planning a route on Komoot, the paths may not always be what you expect, but it does make for an interesting morning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Living in England you learn to take advantage of the good weather when it presents itself. Today is Bank Holiday Monday and as usual it&amp;rsquo;s pouring with rain. Yesterday however was perfect for an early morning bike ride so I made hay and got out first thing for a quick 50k around the &lt;a

&lt;p>It was a very cold start but I soon warmed up and was enjoying the clear air, lack of cars on the roads and the beautiful Shropshire countryside.

&lt;p>At just over 22km its not a hard ride but it does include the fairly painful New York KOM that tops out at 17% right in the middle of it, so there is that ! Fairly sure I have ridden this route multiple times before as well though seemingly not to the end as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t got the achievement in the trophy cabinet but now I do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the last few weeks I have been working my way through the Zwift Achievements and so far have managed to complete 61% of the routes ( 46 out of 76 ), obviously not all in the last few weeks&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img
src="/images/2020-08-04-zwift-planning/zwift-progress.png"

&lt;p>Until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen an easy way of tracking progress on Zwift without actually sitting on my bike, launching Zwift, starting a ride and then navigating to the achievements section. The Zwift companion app does a fairly poor job of showing you historical activity other than the chronological list of activities completed. Then I came across &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://youtu.be/KgSfajJzW6M"
>this video from GPLama&lt;/a> in which he explains how to use a third party web site called &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://zwifthub.com"
>Zwifthub&lt;/a> to keep track of all your Zwift badges and achievements. You can setup a Zwifthub account or login with a Google account (unfortunately there is no direct link to your Zwift account) and manually update your profile with all your achievements to date. After that you can use the simple filters in the web site sidebar to show you which routes you have completed, which are still to be done, which are available to ride today and then further sort the lists by distance, elevation, gradient etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site is simple in focus but very well executed and fills the gap left by Zwift extremely well. I would imagine that many other Zwifters would find this service useful or at least interesting, even if they are not aiming to complete all the routes and badges on Zwift.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="https://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/blog" term="blog" label="blog"/><category scheme="https://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Zwift" term="Zwift" label="Zwift"/><category scheme="https://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Cycling" term="Cycling" label="Cycling"/></entry><entry><title>Zwift Tron Bike at last !</title><link href="https://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-07-26-zwift-tron-bike-at-last/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>https://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-07-26-zwift-tron-bike-at-last/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">
&lt;p>Yesterday was a big day on &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://zwift.com"
>Zwift&lt;/a> for me. Finally after about 18 months of rides I passed the 50,000m climbing needed to be awarded the &lt;a

>Zwift Concept Z1&lt;/a> better known by Zwifters as the Tron Bike !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prior to my ride yesterday I had around 800m of climb left to do so decided what better way to knock off those last metres than to do it on &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://zwiftinsider.com/massive-alpe-du-zwift-climb-released/"
>Alpe du Zwift&lt;/a>. I was about 3/4 of the way up when the notification popped onto the screen to say I had been awarded the Tron bike. As you can see from the picture I took the opportunity when I got to the top to quickly change over to my new steed for the ride down again (with suitably large smile on my face!)&lt;/p>
