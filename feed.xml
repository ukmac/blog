&lt;p>Over the Christmas break I have been testing out a few different Linux Distros on a Microsoft Surface Go Laptop. This laptop was my test machine for Windows 11 but the experience was less than favourable, slow, unresponsive and noisy as the fan seemed to run pretty constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a brief test of &lt;a

>Pop!_OS&lt;/a>. On this laptop Pop!_OS runs really well, performance is snappy and the fan rarely kicks in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing this as a work machine for me means installing Microsoft Edge as my default browser. Unfortunately the Linux version of Edge is still missing Azure AD sign in and sync which is a real shame and surprising given that Windows and Mac versions have had this feature for a long time now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all my&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Earlier in the year long before lockdown (that seems such a long time ago now) one of my co-workers at &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.camphillvillagetrust.org.uk"
>The Camphill Village Trust&lt;/a> asked if I would be interested in doing a sponsored bike ride for the charities 65th anniversary which is this year. I was of course up for it and we originally planned on an early Summer event riding from our offices in Stourbridge to one of our sites in Gloucestershire (Taurus Crafts) which was coincidentally 65 miles away (105k).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after making these preliminary plans we went into the first national lockdown and the plans got parked for another day. Yesterday we finally managed to fit the ride in and so far have raised over £1000 as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ride we undertook was planned on Komoot and is &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/279396580"

class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4285459080"

&lt;p>New MacBook Air ( M1 Edition ) arrived this afternoon and just wow&amp;hellip;. I am so glad I was tempted by the Amazon Black Friday £100 off and 5 months interest free credit deal now. Before I saw the Amazon deal I had been toing and froing for a few weeks since the new M1 Macs were launched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I am setting it up and synching photos etc and after an hour and a half on my lap its not even warm ! Amazing stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course its hard to say anything that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already been said far more eloquently that I can. Universal acclaim has been laid on these new Macs from all corners of the Internet and it really does seem like a new standard has been set, it just remains to be seen if anyone is capable of meeting the challenge of creating machines that come anything close to what Apple have done with their new Macs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A belated Happy Christmas greeting to anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this blog, hope yours went as well as could be given the world in which we find ourselves. For my part Christmas was quiet and fairly relaxed and as usual over quicker than you can imagine. The actual day this year did feel quite &amp;ldquo;christmassy&amp;rdquo; due to the morning frost and clear blue sky which was really nice. Today on the first Boxing Day of 2020 (the second official one is on Monday) was slightly less so although it did manage to stay dry here in Telford until after dark. Tonight we are in for a bit of a storm as Storm Bella makes her way across the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to get out on my bike this afternoon for a quick 25k before dark which was nice especially as the roads were really quiet (almost like being back in the first lockdown again). My route tonight didnt take wind direction into account though so after an quick assisted outbound ride the return was a little slower as I battled into the early part of Storm Bella.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I took a break from Zwift and headed out early to do a ride round the lanes near to home. I had planned a 50 loop on Komoot parts of which we familiar to me but a few bits that were new. The new bits turned out to include a couple of short off road sections, the first of which was easy enough, but the second not so much. After taking a left onto a farm track at Howle and riding about 1km up a steady hill the track just disappeared into a mass of hedgerow, nettles and brambles. Despite my best efforts and the fact that I could hear the road that I was trying to get to behind the fields to my right, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way through and ended up re-tracing my steps down the track and back onto the main road. I suppose this is part of the risk with planning a route on Komoot, the paths may not always be what you expect, but it does make for an interesting morning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It seems somewhat coincidental that this should happen on the first day that the new Apple TV is available to buy in stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apples requirement for a share of the revenues from subscription services accessed by their devices has been an issue in the past and it may be that this is a play by Amazon to try to force a better deal from Apple. It will certainly be interesting to see how this plays out and what the response from Apple and Google is to this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The rise in the prevelance of
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware"
>Ransomware&lt;/a> hasn&amp;rsquo;t really impacted on Mac Users as it has with the Windows community so far&amp;hellip;
Of course the Mac has benefited from a secure design and being a smaller (relatively) target over the years, but with the growth in use of OS X and the maturity of the tools used by unscrupulous elements this security by obscurity can no longer be guaranteed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the official downloadable version of the popular BitTorrent client,
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.transmissionbt.com"
>Transmission&lt;/a>, was infected with a Ransomware client (
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeRanger"
>KeRanger&lt;/a>) in March year it seemed that the reality had come home to roost. The fact is Ransomware poses one of the biggest risks to everyones personal data so it is exciting to hear of a company who are trying to tackle the issue with a form of early detection and blocking for this type of computer virus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://objective-see.com/"
>Objective-see&lt;/a> is a company created by Patrick Wardle to publish security tools to protect Mac users and one of his products recently released,
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://objective-see.com/products/ransomwhere.html"
>RansomWhere?&lt;/a>, aims to mitigate the impact of a Ransomware infection. It does this by monitoring for activity that looks like Ransomware, notably the rapid modification of multiple files. When it detects suspicious access it identifies and stops the process responsible and prompts the user to warn them that there is a potential ongoing infection. It then offers the option of killing the process or if the alert is a false positive triggered by some known bulk update process for example, to ignore it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach is not infallible and of course there may still be a small number of files encrypted before it detects what is going on but if it prevents hundreds or thousands of documents from being irretrievably encrypted (without handing over cash to the Ransomware creators) it is certainly better than nothing, especially when you consider that this is not a pay monthly service or even a pay-for app but is in fact free to download. It should be noted that this is not a fully developed solution and is more of a working proof of concept so you may chose to wait for future more stable version arrives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patrick&amp;rsquo;s site goes into quite a bit of detail which might put off less technical users and I wonder if this program works well whether it should be launched in a more user friendly package ? It&amp;rsquo;s great to know the detail behind a solution such as this but most users are not that interested, they just need to know what it does and how to install. The low level information can be presented in technical specification page or a blog post. Speaking of which Patrick has a really interesting article on his site titled
&lt;a

&lt;p>The question I guess then is how many people will pay to use it beyond the trial period. My own experience so far is that I will continue to use it as I am finding the new music recommendations far superior to Spotify and the fact that the whole family can use it at the same time ( for a small increase in cost ) just seals the deal.&lt;/p>

>Copied&lt;/a> has recently become one of my favourite apps for iOS and OS X. It is a slick and useful clipboard manager that makes cut/copy and paste on iPhone,iPad and Mac much more useful and when combined with multiple devices introduces a new capability that was previously only possible by emailing or Messaging between devices. That feature is the ability to copy something on one device then jump over to another and paste that data on another device !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The

>iOS version&lt;/a> has a free to use version that allows you to save up to 10 entries into the clipboard and to recall any of these to paste into another app. The entries can be free text, images and links and importantly can be edited after being captured into the clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="gblog-post__anchorwrap">

In Use on iOS
&lt;a data-clipboard-text="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-04-06-copied-sync-clipboard-ios-os-x/#in-use-on-ios" class="gblog-post__anchor clip flex align-center" aria-label="Anchor In Use on iOS" href="#in-use-on-ios">
&lt;svg class="gblog-icon gblog_link">&lt;use xlink:href="#gblog_link">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Pasting an existing entry from the clipboard can be done in a number of ways. Firstly you can load the app and scroll through the list of entries to find the one you want. Once located tap on the entry and it opens in an editor where ( if the entry is text ) you can edit the contents of the clipboard if required. From here you also have a standard iOS Share button which allows you to send the entry to a suitable app as a new item ( document/tweet/Message etc ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively you can click on the three dots icon to either copy the entry into the current clipboard ( so you can paste it into another app/document ), Share using a template or Transform the text if applicable. Transforming text gives options to convert to upper/lower/title case, removing whitespace etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;svg class="gblog-icon gblog_link">&lt;use xlink:href="#gblog_link">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other method for accessing clipboard entries is through the Copied keyboard. This is accessed in the same way as other third party iOS keyboards by tapping the globe key on the standard keyboard to cycle through any additional keyboards you have installed. The keyboard replaces the normal keys with a grid of clipboard entries which you can scroll through ( sideways ) to find the entry you wish to paste into your document or text. Just tap the entry to paste the data at the cursor. Simple.&lt;/p>

&lt;svg class="gblog-icon gblog_link">&lt;use xlink:href="#gblog_link">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>For a small in-app purchase ( £1.49 in UK ) the basic free version can be upgraded to Copied+ which increases the clipboard size to 1,000 items and also includes the ability to organise clippings into Lists for better organisation. For example I have is a list of clippings for my address, mobile phone number etc which I can then use to quickly enter these into web forms.

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The synchronisation doesn&amp;rsquo;t end with iOS though, when used in conjunction with the OS X version of the app data can be easily transferred between Mac and iPhone/iPad in just the same way. This is an incredibly useful feature and one that would really fit into the core operating system on these devices if Apple ever saw fit to develop this, however for now
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg"
>Copied&lt;/a> fills this space very nicely. It should be said that the OS X version of the app is £5.99 which isn&amp;rsquo;t free and there are other apps that provide similar features, but in my experience using Copied is a smooth and effective way of improving the way in which I can transfer data between apps on my iPhone and also between iPhone and Mac and I believe the overall benefit is worth the small outlay.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following a recent re-brand of our charity the Marketing team distributed a number of new template documents to various teams throughout the organisation and it wasnt until after this had happened that I discovered the blank Word template they had issued was over 26MB !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically they had dropped a full page high resolution image onto the document to create the header and footer that resulted in a huge template. I immediately recreated ( my version was 80KB ! ) using compressed versions of the graphics cut out from their original and sent back to them, but of course the big template was already in the wild. I did manage to track down a few areas who had already created their own templates based on the huge original by running a quick Powershell script to filter out Word documents over 2MB. The script is reproduced below if you are interested&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get-ChildItem *.docx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {$&lt;em>.Length -gt 2MB} | Sort-Object length -Descending | Select-Object Name,Directory,@{n=&amp;lsquo;GB&amp;rsquo;;e={&amp;quot;{0:N2}&amp;quot; -F ($&lt;/em>.length/ 1MB)}} | Format-List Name,Directory,GB&lt;/p>

The configuration on the copier was all ok and there had been no changes to our network so I was more than a little stumped until I finally got the user who had reported the issue to admit they were trying to scan a large pile of pages and that the one page scan they had tried had worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lightbulb moment, checked the copiers maximum attachment size that was set to 2Mb, changed to 8Mb, asked user to retry and hey presto 3Mb attachment arrived in their inbox. Hurrah !&lt;/p>

Currently I don&amp;rsquo;t have any great need for long battery life as I am working at home like most others but knowing that there is no rush to get plugged is nice and so far the lowest the battery has gone is 50% ( at the time I am writing this blog post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night was the first time I felt the bottom of the case get warm. I had just helped my son set up a Zoom call when I noticed it. It may have been Zoom, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate it at the time and since then its been cool cool cool&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whilst setting up the apps I wanted I decided to try to find a decent mail client for my home Gmail account. I have used the Gmail web interface for a long time more out of laziness than anything so this seemed an opportune time to look for a better alternative. &lt;a

>Mimestream&lt;/a> is free to download at the moment during the beta period. It has a very Gmail-like layout and supports all the Gmail features such as labels that typically don&amp;rsquo;t work well in standard email clients. I will post an update on my thoughts when I have been using it for a while but so far I am quite happy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today has been a painful day trying to resolve an issue with Mail rules in Exchange Online. Yesterday I switched on a Malware Policy to block certain files types after reading &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://regarding365.com/a-little-bit-more-security-fb6825ef8435?source=rss----604cd9a532f6---4"
>this article.&lt;/a> All seemed fine but then first thing this morning I received a number of calls from users unable to email Helpdesk calls to our Helpdesk system (&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.freshdesk.com"
>Freshdesk&lt;/a>). It seems as though the change I made yesterday had triggered a mail rule setup to block users autoforwarding emails externally into action that must not have been working before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To log calls with Freshdesk by email you send to a specific email address that is created when Freshdesk is configured. To make things easy for my organisations users I had setup a shared mailbox with the email address support@xxxx and instructed them to log calls by emailing this address. The shared mailbox was then set to autoforward to the Freshdesk email address. This autoforward was now broken and so users were unable to log calls or reply to existing ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately trying to fix mail rules in Exchange is made more difficult due to the very long time it takes for changes made to become operational. According to &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_exchon-mso_o365b/dlp-and-mail-transport-rules-in-eac/75486160-ee0e-4cc2-a9cb-a9311630cf83"
>Lance Cal in this Microsoft Community thread&lt;/a> changes can take up to 12 hours to become active. Thats a whole working day before I can see if the change I made to fix our issue works and during which time our IT Helpdesk that relies on email autoforward rules to operate remains unusable.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="gblog-post__anchorwrap">

&lt;a data-clipboard-text="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-08-daily-post/#update" class="gblog-post__anchor clip flex align-center" aria-label="Anchor Update" href="#update">
&lt;svg class="gblog-icon gblog_link">&lt;use xlink:href="#gblog_link">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It seems that Exchange mail rules is not what I should have been looking at after all. What I discovered was that the mail rule I thought was blocking the autoforward was not being triggered at all. I found this by running the mail rule report ( shown highlighted in red in diagram below )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img
src="/images/2020-12-08-daily-post/mail-rule-report.jpg"
alt=""
title="Mail rule report"
/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I could see that no emails were matching the rule I started looking for other places where autoforwarding might be blocked. I had suspected there was probably something in the 365 Security and Compliance site that was responsible and the obvious culprit was in the &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://protection.office.com/antispam"
>Anti-Spam&lt;/a> settings. What I found here was that the &amp;ldquo;Automatic forwarding&amp;rdquo; setting was set to &amp;ldquo;Automatic - System-controlled&amp;rdquo;. Changing this to &amp;ldquo;On - Forwarding is enabled&amp;rdquo; immediately resolved the issue I was having but of course at the same time changed the default policy for all users to allow auto-forwarding externally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img
src="/images/2020-12-08-daily-post/outboundspam.jpg"
alt=""
title="Outbound spam filter policy"
/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fix this I needed to add a new Outbound policy that blocked all users from autoforwarding but excluded the Helpdesk shared mailbox. The rule below does this and the best part is changes are effective immediately so no waiting for 12 hours for mail rules to take effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img
src="/images/2020-12-08-daily-post/outboundrule.jpg"

&lt;p>A long day but hopefully one where I learned something about the way that mail policies work.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Microsoft" term="Microsoft" label="Microsoft"/><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Office-365" term="Office-365" label="Office 365"/><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Daily-Post" term="Daily-Post" label="Daily Post"/></entry><entry><title>Daily Post - 09/12/2020</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-09-daily-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-09-daily-post/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">

&lt;p>Whew..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Relaxing on the decking with a well deserved beer after a busy Saturday. Badminton at Oakengates Leisure Centre with the kids this morning then a trip over to eldest&amp;rsquo;s new house to help with sorting the garden which was a tad overgrown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still loving the iPad Pro and Apple Magic keyboard and so glad I finally overcame the reservations over price and bought one ( though it was helped by the fact that I got mine for half price as a second user unit through Amazon ). I am looking forward to the forthcoming release of macOS Monterey and the new Universal Control feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finished the Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s new book, Billy Summers on Audible on the drive to Yorkshire this week. Unusual for King that there is no supernatural or horror element ( apart from a few very brief references to The Shining ) but I really enjoyed it none the less. One of those Audible books that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get into the car to carry on listening to and was gutted when it finished.&lt;/p>

I started using it early in the beta and immediately decided it was the way forward for myself and my work ( I pushed it out to all PCs early too ), but on my iPad there are things that bug me. The big one is when I create a new tab and start typing a URL or search term only to look at the screen and see nothing has appeared because I haven&amp;rsquo;t selected the address field ( clicked into it or pressed CMD-L ). Not sure if its me but if you open a tab in a browser what else would you normally do but enter a URL or search term ? Why can&amp;rsquo;t it select the address bar ready without having to manually select it ?

I am staying at the Jury&amp;rsquo;s Inn in Watford and just back from evening meal in the bar that was pretty rubbish. I ordered burger and chips for £15. The burger was overcooked, dry and tasteless and the chips had been covered in salt ( which I dont eat on food ) so were pretty much inedible. I should have taken myself out into town to find somewhere to eat but after an early start and a long day I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered and opted for the easy option of eating in the hotel. I&amp;rsquo;ll never learn, hotel food is generally pretty meh and often worse than that.

Its a pretty basic application (when you launch it there isn&amp;rsquo;t even a gui interface displayed, just a set of menu options on the menu bar) but is still updated and the latest version even has native Apple Silicon support. There is also a command line version of the app for those who prefer to work in a terminal window.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I came across this article on &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/"
>MacStories&lt;/a> in which Federico Vittici describes how he uses Working Copy and GitHub to manage his writing with &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172"
>iA Writer&lt;/a> and &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pretext/id1347707000"
>Pretext&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I have been testing Working Copy I have tried creating a synced folder with the local Obsidian app folders and also with the Obsidians folder in iCloud. Both seemed to work fine but I was a bit unsure whether syncing with iCloud was recommended and hadn’t found any articles to confirm this was something you should do (in the past this sort of approach would have been a recipe for duplicated files and other odd issues). Anyway I am pleased that Federico’s article confirmed that this was ok and in fact makes editing in-place with multiple editors easy (I am writing this in iA Writer and the file is in the Obsidian iCloud folder which is synced to GitHub with Working Copy so there you are…)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last night my MacBook&amp;rsquo;s iTunes was updated with the latest release ( 12.2.1.16 ) and when it restarted I was prompted with the invitation to Join Apple Music trial. As I had already signed up I ignored this prompt and clicked through to iTunes assuming it was some sort of error, however what I noticed then was the For You and New sections at the top of the iTunes window were now missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Restarting iTunes didn&amp;rsquo;t resolve this, nor did logging out of the the Store and back in again. After a number of attempts to recover the missing sections I went into the iTunes Store and clicked onto the 90 Day Trial link ( at the very bottom left of the store ) and hey presto the missing sections re-appeared again !&lt;/p>

class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/2-cars/id936839198?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg"
>2 Cars from Ketchapp&lt;/a>. It is a very simple top to bottom scroller where the objective is to steer your
&lt;strong>2 Cars&lt;/strong>
around the oncoming square blocks whilst at the same time intercepting the round blocks. Any collision with a square block ends the game. Any round block missed also ends the game. Each car can drive in one of two lanes and the only control is to tap the screen on the right to move the right hand car to the alternate lane and the screen on the left to move the left hand car.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sounds simple doesn&amp;rsquo;t it ? Well give it a try and see how far you get, I can pretty much guarantee it will take you quite a few goes before you progress to double digit scores and after that progression is likely to be slow as the speed of the oncoming blocks increases pretty quickly once you get into the 40-50 score bracket.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unless you have a background in IT the chances are that the only time you have ever considered backups of your information was just after you found out you had lost something precious ? Perhaps it was a bunch of irretrievable photos lost when your hard drive suddenly and inexplicably died ? Or maybe it was your lifetimes collection of music or movies, carefully downloaded and collated onto that 4TB external hard drive connected to your desktop computer that you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed had been accidentally deleted ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whichever it was, when the day arrives and you suffer that unrecoverable data loss the chances are you will be asking yourself why you hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to backup to another disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My preferred and recommended backup solution is an online service called
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://backblaze.com"
>Backblaze&lt;/a>. Backblaze is cheap ( as little as $5 a month ), reliable and easy to setup and better yet, once configured you can forget it is there and relax in the knowledge that should the worst happen your data is safe and easily retrieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link--raw"
href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00isdf"
>&lt;img
src="http://ukmac.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/backblaze-trial-300x250.gif"
alt="backblaze trial"
/>&lt;/a>Unlike most Internet file storage solutions (
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="www.dropbox.com"
>Dropbox&lt;/a>,
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="onedrive.com"
>OneDrive&lt;/a> etc ) the cost for Backblaze is the same whether you are backing up 100MB or 20TB ! The only difference will be the amount of time it takes to complete the initial backup, something that is getting easier as home broadband speeds steadily increase. This initial &amp;ldquo;seeding&amp;rdquo; of your backup may take some weeks to complete but it happens in the background and is carefully controlled by the
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="www.backblaze.com"
>Backblaze&lt;/a> software to not interfere with your Internet access too much. Once the first backup is complete the software then only has to update the backup when anything changes to your local data, again a process that happens in the background without manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backblaze will backup any of your hard drives, not just the internal drive in your PC or Mac. Just plugin your external USB drives, configure the application settings and wait for the data to be secured. One thing to note here though is that if you do this Backblaze needs to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; that drive at least once every 30 days or it will assume the data does not need to be retained and will delete it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously paying for backup services is not sexy, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give you anything other than piece of mind, but it is something that everyone who has any amount of data in digital form should consider putting in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to try out Backblaze you can sign up for a
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00isdf"
>months free trial by clicking on this link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is not sponsored by Backblaze it is purely my personal choice of backup service and something that I recommend to friends and relatives when the subject arises.

&lt;p>In the days before the Internet I was a regular magazine subscriber and the shelves in my home office used to groan under the weight of all those glossy pages. My magazine buying days have long since gone, replaced by a diet of online news delivered first by USENET followed by online forums, web sites and most recently RSS feeds read through services like
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://feedly.com"
>Feedly.com&lt;/a> or apps like
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://flipboard.com"
>Flipboard&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier this year I started a volunteer role at my local library to show local residents how to use the library computers or if they prefer their own devices to get more out of the Internet and PC and tablet applications. It was during my familiarisation with the library services on their web site that I came across
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://www.telford.gov.uk/info/1012/libraries/668/emagazines"
>this page&lt;/a> ! Basically library members can register for FREE to access a range of magazines through the popular service 
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://zinio.com"
>Zinio.com&lt;/a>. Zinio has been around for a long time and I had looked at the magazines available through the service over the years, in fact before I spotted the library link I had been debating subscribing to National Geographic for cash ! So glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t now as the Nat Geo is one of the magazines available through the Telford library service for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that is needed to take advantage of the deal is a library membership card ( available for free to local residents ). Once you are a member you can register through the link on the library web site which gives you access to select from the range of magazines that the library make available ( currently 31 titles at Telford ) and download to your tablet/desktop Zinio reader app or to read online through the Zinio web site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since signing up for this service I have spoken with a variety of friends and work colleagues and told them how I can access magazines online for free. When we have looked at the services available from their local libraries ( Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall etc ) we have discovered that they also offer the same sort of service. In fact most of them have a wider range of magazine titles available than my library in Telford !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to subscribe to this service head over to your local library web site and do a search for Zinio, I am betting that you will find there is a free service available to you that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was there !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy,&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>I converted to the new Microsoft Edge browser what seems like an age ago now and one of the things I was eager to see rolled out was the history and open tabs sync between devices (which you can of course already do with Firefox&amp;hellip; ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an Office 365 user and system admin the new Edge browser is clearly the way to finally get a single managed browser across all of my organisations devices, and to be honest I can&amp;rsquo;t see any good reason for other organisations like mine to still be using Chrome/Firefox other than industry inertia. So I rolled out Edge to my users many months ago now and am happy to report no real issues at all, but I have still been a little frustrated at the slow pace around the completion of the sync options.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a non-expert in the field of web development I know what I want to do and roughly how to achieve it but working out the detail of how to make the changes I need, especially where the theme is a remote Jekyl theme, is a challenge. This post includes a number of sites that I have found that have helped me to find the solutions to this.&lt;/p>

>Monosnap&lt;/a> is a free utility for OS X and Windows that can quickly and easily capture screenshots and save them for editing and annotation, ideal for grabbing images for documentation or publishing to social media streams.
more The included editing tools are basic but adequate with the usual circles, rectangles, crop, line capability but also and importantly for screen capture a blur tool for obscuring passwords or other areas with sensitive information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unlike most of the apps of this type though Monosnap has a power feature for bloggers and potential YouTubers, the ability to record a video of the screen including a lower thirds capture of your webcam to add narration with video to give your video tutorials a personal touch. The area captured can be adjusted to cover just the window or application required or expanded to record the whole screen if required.&lt;/p>

Depending on your needs and workflow this might be something you would find useful but personally I am happy to save to my desktop for subsequent upload to Wordpress and don&amp;rsquo;t see much benefit in this facility. YMMV.&lt;/p>

Erase All Content And Settings which did the trick !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously if you are affected by this issue and decide to do a complete Erase make sure you have all your settings and passwords available beforehand as you will need to setup accounts and applications from scratch afterwards ( don&amp;rsquo;t try restoring old backups because you will most likely just restore the problem ).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After many years of on and off dabbling with Wordpress blogs I have decided to make the move to &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
>Jekyll&lt;/a> and &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://pages.github.com/"
>Github Pages&lt;/a> for hosting. Jekyll is very different to Wordpress and requires a completely different skill set to implement. It is easy enough to pickup if you have a good understanding of IT but probably not a simple job if you don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically I spend more time playing with setting up blogs than I do actually blogging. I always have good intentions which quickly fade after the fun of setting up the site is done. Perhaps this time will be different ? I have managed to import the few posts I had on Wordpress into Jekyll, albeit some of them needed manual tweaks and possibly some are still a little broken, but again this was more for the fun of doing it than the need to retain the posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment I am using &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
>Visual Studio Code&lt;/a> on my Mac Mini for content editing and testing changes by running Jekyll locally ( there is a short delay after pushing updates to Github for the changes to reflect on your site so having a localhost version running is an essential configuration for most purposes.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This site is currently (at the time this post was written) using the &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"
>Minimal Mistakes theme&lt;/a> by Michael Rose. This theme is relatively basic compared to many Wordpress themes but has the functionality I need for this blog while still offering a degree of customisation, which is where I have got to at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I am enjoying learning Jekyll and will aim to carry on developing this site, though I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee I won&amp;rsquo;t get bored with it as I have done many times in the past. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p>

>Near Lock&lt;/a> is a new pair of apps for iOS and OS X that allows you to unlock your Mac with your iPhone or Apple Watch. Once installed and configured the app can be configured to lock or unlock your Mac as soon as it detects the presence of your iPhone. The sensitivity of the detection can be adjusted from as little as 1m to as much as 10m so you can optimise the point at which it locks or unlocks your Mac according to your requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app works with recent iPhones and Macs that support Bluetooth LE and as a result can be left switched on all the time without it causing a significant drain on iPhone batteries. Furthermore the currently free in app upgrade to the Pro version on iOS allows the app to work even when in the background so there is no need to unlock your iPhone or run an app to unlock your Mac. If you are worried that just being able to walk up to your Mac with your iPhone is a little insecure ( think someone gets your phone and can unlock and access your Mac ) then the iOS app can be setup to require Touch ID authentication before it will unlock which is a nice but still convenient way of accessing your Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wonderful stuff&amp;hellip; Get it now while it is free !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My normal approach when a new version of OS X is released is to backup ( create a
&lt;a

Firstly disk space has been getting low on my 256GB drive which is never great but then I started to experience a problem with the App Store taking a long time to load which deteriorated to the point where no matter how long I left it running the content in the main panes failed to materialise at all. As I wanted to load a particular new app this was a bit of a problem to say the least. I looked for solutions to the issue without much success ( admittedly I didn&amp;rsquo;t look that hard ) before deciding to do a re-install to freshen up my OS.&lt;/p>

I also now have 140GB of my 256GB drive still free which shows how much disk space can get swallowed up by working files and general detritus in the course of a year. Granted there are a few things I have chosen not to restore but nothing that would account for 100GB of disk space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, all this brings me to the point of this article which is how to enable three finger drag of windows in
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac"
>El Capitan&lt;/a> ! When the re-install had finished one of the first things I did was to go to System Preferences to sort out my Trackpad settings. By default my three main tweaks to the standard configuration are to switch off natural scrolling ( I know old habits die hard ), switch on tap to click and finally switch on the option to drag windows with three finger gesture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around the first two options were setup as normal but when I looked for the three finger drag option it seemed to have been moved. I was sure it used to be on the Scroll and Zoom section of the preference pane, or was it under More Gestures ? Nope, not there&amp;hellip; I must admit I looked for an embarrassingly long time going from one tab to the next in the vain hope that somehow I would see it where I hadn&amp;rsquo;t before, but it was gone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully it only took a minutes Googling to uncover the answer to the missing setting, Apple in their infinite wisdom have decided in
&lt;a

href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac"
>El Capitan&lt;/a> that this is not a Trackpad setting now but an Accessibility option ! To find the setting now first go to Accessibility in System Preferences, click on  
&lt;strong>Trackpad Options&lt;/strong>
and on the popup window tick to
&lt;strong>Enable dragging&lt;/strong>
 and select
&lt;strong>three finger drag&lt;/strong>
from the drop down menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course the other thing I
&lt;strong>should have done&lt;/strong>
was to just type &amp;ldquo;three finger drag&amp;rdquo; into the search field in System Preferences which would have instantly told me I was looking in the wrong place !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I have created an app that uses the AzureAD connector to find the logged in users account details (Office location) only to find that when deploying this app to actual users ( who aren&amp;rsquo;t Azure AD admins ) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work !

&lt;p>As is often the case when learning something new I have run into a problem and the fix for it is alluding me at the moment. In this case it is RSS feeds in Jekyll. The [Minimal Mistakes[(https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)] theme already had jekyll-feed gem installed which appeared to be working but when I checked my feed in &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://feedly.com"
>Feedly&lt;/a> I could only see posts that were previously posted on my Wordpress blog and none of the new test posts on Jekyll were showing up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If anyone does have any experience of this issue with Jekyll and can offer any sort of clue to a fix I would be very grateful, meanwhile I will continue my search.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Jekyll" term="Jekyll" label="Jekyll"/></entry><entry><title>Rumour - Ultra-thin 13" and 15" MacBooks due in June-July</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-03-26-rumour-ultra-thin-13-15-macbooks-due-june-july/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-03-26-rumour-ultra-thin-13-15-macbooks-due-june-july/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">

LIBERTY LAUNCHES FILM TO BRING HOME TRUE SCALE OF NEW SNOOPERS’ CHARTER

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Human rights group Liberty has today launched a short film highlighting the unprecedented, unnecessary and deeply intrusive spying powers handed to hundreds of public bodies by the latest incarnation of the Snoopers’ Charter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The video created by Liberty and creative agency Don’t Panic, sees comedian Olivia Lee take to the streets demanding a look at strangers’ most personal and sensitive information – the same information to which a broad range of public bodies will gain unfettered access if the Investigatory Powers Bill becomes law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team who brought you ‘The Revolution Will Be Televised’ got together again to bring you ‘Show me yours&amp;hellip;.’. Joe Wade, MD at Don’t Panic notes: &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“We used hidden cameras to pick up people’s reaction caused by Olivia’s invasive baiting which highlights that people do and should care about their privacy. The use of hidden cameras was to reflect the very nature of how the government plans to pass this bill, hidden from the public and to convey a sense of unwarranted invasiveness that will come with the Snoopers’ Charter.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Liberty is calling on the public to sign up to its No #SnoopersCharter campaign and urge their MPs to reject the Bill when they vote on it this summer. This is one of the most intrusive and least accountable surveillance regimes in the world. There is a consensus from service providers, tech experts and three cross-party parliamentary committees that its plans are unclear, unworkable and potentially unlawful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bill, currently being rushed through Parliament, will force telecoms companies to store everybody’s communications data for an entire year, this includes every site we visit, every communication programme and app we use, every system update we download and details of any device we use to go online (at huge cost to the public purse).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bill would also legalise:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mass hacking of phones and other devices by the intelligence agencies, capable of dangerously undermining Britain’s digital infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bulk interception of calls, emails, online exchanges and texts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acquiring vast databases containing personal information on millions of people – potentially the whole population.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Powers to force telecoms operators here and abroad, from Gmail, Facebook and Twitter to offices, businesses and law firms, to remove encryption – and ban them from revealing they have been forced to do so.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Bella Sankey, Policy Director for Liberty, said: “As this film shows, people in Britain value their personal privacy – even Home Office staff are unwilling to reveal their phone records for no good reason. But the Government’s latest Snoopers’ Charter would make everyone’s online activity available to the authorities to speculatively trawl through without good reason and without us ever being told.It will all but end online privacy, put our personal security at risk and swamp law enforcement with swathes of useless information. People need to make it clear to MPs – we don’t want the Government building profiles of our personal lives with no justification and this Bill must stopped.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Joe Wade, MD, Don’t Panic: “We are delighted to have worked with Liberty to make this video. Many people are complaisant about the surveillance bill, and so we wanted to highlight how invasive it will be! For this video we used a political satire format that has hugely successful for other videos we have created. Our aim was to create something that would tackle this challenging and very relevant subject in an honest way. Our team worked very closely with Liberty throughout the process; from establishing the initial hidden camera concept to developing the tone/messaging, to filming and the final delivery.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of my pet peeves is the number of plastic cards I have to carry in my wallet. Most of the time I tend to strip the contents to the essential debit cards that I use all the time but this sometimes means that I miss out on discounts or other benefits by not having a particular stores loyalty card with me.&lt;/p>

>Stocard&lt;/a> solves this little problem by providing a simple way of importing store loyalty cards into your iPhone allowing you to leave the plastic at home without having to pass up on the discounts or loyalty points. Adding cards is very quick, just search for the store name from the extensive list then scan the card bar code using the iPhone camera and the cards details are captured. Now you can present the bar code on your iPhone to the cashier when making a purchase and they can scan this instead of the plastic. The app can also store card details for shops/companies not listed including adding a photo of the card for easy reference. I have used it to import my library cards for example.&lt;/p>

>Stocard&lt;/a> do acknowledge that some older scanners aren&amp;rsquo;t able to read the iPhone screen but in these cases the bar code can be entered manually by the cashier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app is available for iOS and Android and is a free download.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All you need to do is double tap on a text field and the on screen keyboard will pop smoothly into view.

&lt;p>A little while ago I looked at a device called the
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://eu.minidrive.bynifty.com/#"
>Nifty MiniDrive&lt;/a> a neat little MicroSD card carrier that fits completely snuggly into the SD slot on MacBooks adding disk space for photos/documents and other temporary files. They are relatively cheap and can be used with whatever size of MicroSD card you have available. The downside is that the disk space provided is a separate volume to the internal drive and as such you have to manage which files and folders go where. It is certainly a neater solution than plugging a USB drive into your MacBook but if the internal drive is struggling for space it doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately solve that issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then last night I came across a product called
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://tardisk.com"
>TarDisk Pear&lt;/a> which uses the same idea of plugging extra storage into the SD card slot in a completely flush carrier but extends it to the next level. With the TarDisk Pear instead of the extra disk space being presented as an external removable volume the additional storage is magically used to extend the space available to the internal drive ! The web site doesn&amp;rsquo;t give many details on exactly how it does this but there are a few hints on the FAQ&amp;rsquo;s page where it talks about the risk of data corruption and loss if you remove the drive after it has been setup. Clearly the magic comes at a price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img
src="http://ukmac.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TarDisk_Pear_2.0-1024x342.gif"
alt="TarDisk_Pear_2.0"
/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite looking I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about the impact on the performance of the built in drive either. I would hope that it manages the data in a way that optimises the performance of the internal drive but this isn&amp;rsquo;t clear from what I have seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pricing starts at $149 for 128GB rising to £399 for 256GB.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Mac-Hardware" term="Mac-Hardware" label="Mac Hardware"/></entry><entry><title>Teams Tip - Zooming shared screen</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2019-08-25-877/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2019-08-25-877/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">

&lt;p>A few weeks ago I happened across a previously owned Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad 12.9&amp;quot; on Amazon at a big discount. I have tried to justify £350 for a keyboard since I bought the 12.9&amp;quot; iPad Pro but just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a compelling enough reason but when I saw this one I figured I would take a punt and if it was no good I could always return it. Well that was a while back now and I am still a happy Magic Keyboard owner. It really does make the iPad Pro into a powerhouse portable device. The keyboard is great and the trackpad works as you would expect from an Apple device, smooth and slick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pretty much only using the iPad when not at my desk now, even though I also have the amazing M1 MacBook Air ( lucky me eh ? ) and now Obsidian is out on iPad I have decided to try to use it on the iPad for updating this blog. To do this does require something to sync to GitHub and this is where WorkingCopy comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working Copy is a full git client for iOS and at £17.99 is not a cheap app but it seems to be the only real option for this sort of workflow and is an established solution so if you have a need for git on iPad its a bit of a no-brainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, this is my first post using this setup and it worked first time which is great. Maybe I will finally start posting here a bit more ( how many times have I written that ? )&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/iOS" term="iOS" label="iOS"/></entry><entry><title>TextExpander Alternatives for Disgruntled Smile Customers</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-04-07-textexpander-alternatives-disgruntled-smile-customers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-04-07-textexpander-alternatives-disgruntled-smile-customers/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">
&lt;p>Over the last couple of days there has been a lot written about the

>Smile Software&lt;/a> decision to move to a subscription model for version 6 of
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://textexpander.com/"
>TextExpander&lt;/a>more, their popular text snippet app for OS X and iOS. Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://textexpander.com/"
>TextExpander&lt;/a> pay its way are not simple and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know if the change was actually an unavoidable option, but regardless of the reasons behind the decision it is fairly clear that a fair number of Smiles previous customers will be thinking twice about the upgrade and looking at alternative options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few alternatives to
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://textexpander.com/"
>TextExpander&lt;/a> and one of the main ones,
&lt;a

href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W"
>offering a discount&lt;/a> to existing TextExpander users to move to their product during April.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app is normally EUR 24.99 for a single user or EUR 37.99 for a family pack so the reduction makes it EUR 18.75 and EUR 28.50 respectively. To access the offer
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W"

&lt;p>If you are not happy spending this much on an alternative then a cheaper option is
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/"
>aText&lt;/a> at just $4.99.###UPDATE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it seems that the reasoning that Smile have given for the decision is based on the sharing features added in the updated version of TextExpander. They state
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/textexpander-release-follow-up"
>on this page&lt;/a> that the iCloud/Dropbox services would not allow them to implement the Group Sharing features that are the key new element of TextExpander.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Group sharing in the new TextExpander is quite different than syncing via Dropbox or iCloud. Sharing, as it stands, couldn’t work using either sync service.&lt;/p>

>the coming podcast surplus&lt;/a> ) by Seth Godin describes a problem ( of the third world variety ) that I have experienced for some time and I suspect you may have too, that is the growing number of streams of entertainment competing for my attention and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been a regular podcast listener since my first iPod many years ago when
&lt;a

href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/britishmac/id118558840?mt=2"
>BritishMac&lt;/a> Podcast were my routine companions on the drive too and from work. Since the early days of podcasting there has been a rapid growth in the number of podcast networks and shows within those networks which is great to a point. The problem comes in deciding which ones are worthy of attention and how to sample new ones whilst at the same time keeping up with the regulars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the shows I listen to average around 2 hours per episode which for me is a whole days commuting ( 1 hour in each direction ). With only 4-5 working days drives a week ( I work at home on average once a week ) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much room for new podcasts to find their way onto my playlist, especially as I tend to also have an
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://www.audible.com"
>Audible&lt;/a>title on the go most of the time as well. The result of this is that I tend to continue to listen to mostly the same content and only occasionally change or add new podcasts to my player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My current playlist looks something like this :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[table id=2 /]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the regulars above I have a small list of irregular shows that I sample when I feel like it, mostly from the same podcast networks as the list above but with the odd variant thrown in for good measure. One that I dropped on a while ago that turned out to be so gripping that my regular playlist went out of the window until I had finished it was the
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="http://serialpodcast.org/"
>Serial Podcast&lt;/a>. This is a fascinating series of 10 episodes following a murder that happened in Baltimore in 1999 hosted by Sarah Koenig and was a spin off of This American Life. Not my normal techie faire but I really enjoyed this one and am actually looking forward to the forthcoming follow up series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose like Seth I have to accept that the reality is that I will never be able to listen to all the content that I might want to, there is simply too much to handle. It is also good news for anyone who has not yet ventured away from broadcast radio into the world of podcasts, believe me once you start you will continue and will probably not bother with commercial FM/DAB radio again !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I setup this Jekyll blog a few months ago and as usual after getting it going I promptly let it languish. One of the issues I guess is that unlike Wordpress there is no quick iOS or web app out of the box to update Jekyll sites from my phone or iPad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://prosie.io"
>Prose.io&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prose.io is an elegant and clean web app for managing Github sites and &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://medium.com/devseed/how-we-build-cms-free-websites-d7e19d94a0ff"
>CMS Free web sites&lt;/a> which also works very nicely on iPads (no app required). To start editing a Jekyll web site all you have to do is go to &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://prose.io"
>https://prose.io&lt;/a> and authenticate with your Github account. You can then open your sites posts folder and either edit existing posts or create new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is the first I have created using the site. The editor is fairly minimal but does have a simple formatting toolbar and a Markdown preview button for checking that your post looks ok before saving and committing changes to Github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will be testing this out with future posts but from what I can see this may well be the ideal way to update my site and certainly easier than trying to work with Github clients on iOS.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Jekyll" term="Jekyll" label="Jekyll"/></entry><entry><title>Using Duet Display As A Primary Monitor</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-01-03-using-duet-display-as-a-primary-monitor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2016-01-03-using-duet-display-as-a-primary-monitor/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">

href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duet-display/id935754064?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg"
>Duet Display&lt;/a> is a slick app developed by ex-Apple employees designed to allow your iPad to function as a second monitor on your laptop or iMac using a lightning or iPad 30 pin cable ( for older iPads ). The application works extremely well with none of the lag or latency in display refresh experienced by some of the alternative apps that use the iPads WiFi connection to transfer screen updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Duet name suggests the intended use for the app is to create an easy to use portable secondary display for MacBook users ( or in fact Windows laptop users as there is a Windows version of the server application as well as one for OS X ) but it isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to this use case. My main use of Duet is as a primary monitor on my Mac Mini media server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have used my Mac Mini in a headless ( no monitor ) setup for a long time and use Screen Sharing from my MacBook to login and manage it, however it recently struck me that the
&lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duet-display/id935754064?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg"
>Duet Display app&lt;/a>that I had purchased some time ago would be perfect for creating a tiny compact keyboard/monitor setup. Combined with a small bluetooth keyboard from Anker and bluetooth mouse I now have full access to my Mini in a compact little setup that looks pretty slick on the shelf in my study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Duet Display is £7.99 in the UK iOS App store which I admit is probably at the high side of many peoples acceptable budget for an app of this type, however this app is extremely good and provides amazing functionally and performance. For people who travel with a MacBook and iPad the benefit of being able to setup a usable dual monitor setup whilst on the move can be liberating, and for home media servers like mine it can create a slick, compact and usable alternative to a bulky VGA/HDMI monitor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>##Microsoft Forms&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am currently trying to create a new starter process with Microsoft Forms/Flow and Sharepoint. One feature that would make this process work a lot better would be to enable the initial Form to have some of the information pre-populated so when it is submitted the information can be linked to existing data in Sharepoint. It seems this is a requirement that others have found lacking in Forms at the moment&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I just came across another one of Microsofts seemingly arbitrary limitations in using policies to manage Windows 10. This one is another example where there is a policy setting that only works if you have Windows 10 Enterprise or Education editions and not for Pro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a policy to lock down the Windows Store to only show applications in your organisations Store then you are going to be out of luck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At just over 22km its not a hard ride but it does include the fairly painful New York KOM that tops out at 17% right in the middle of it, so there is that ! Fairly sure I have ridden this route multiple times before as well though seemingly not to the end as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t got the achievement in the trophy cabinet but now I do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the last few weeks I have been working my way through the Zwift Achievements and so far have managed to complete 61% of the routes ( 46 out of 76 ), obviously not all in the last few weeks&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img

&lt;p>Until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen an easy way of tracking progress on Zwift without actually sitting on my bike, launching Zwift, starting a ride and then navigating to the achievements section. The Zwift companion app does a fairly poor job of showing you historical activity other than the chronological list of activities completed. Then I came across &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://youtu.be/KgSfajJzW6M"
>this video from GPLama&lt;/a> in which he explains how to use a third party web site called &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://zwifthub.com"
>Zwifthub&lt;/a> to keep track of all your Zwift badges and achievements. You can setup a Zwifthub account or login with a Google account (unfortunately there is no direct link to your Zwift account) and manually update your profile with all your achievements to date. After that you can use the simple filters in the web site sidebar to show you which routes you have completed, which are still to be done, which are available to ride today and then further sort the lists by distance, elevation, gradient etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site is simple in focus but very well executed and fills the gap left by Zwift extremely well. I would imagine that many other Zwifters would find this service useful or at least interesting, even if they are not aiming to complete all the routes and badges on Zwift.&lt;/p></content><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/blog" term="blog" label="blog"/><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Zwift" term="Zwift" label="Zwift"/><category scheme="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/tags/Cycling" term="Cycling" label="Cycling"/></entry><entry><title>Zwift Tron Bike at last !</title><link href="http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-07-26-zwift-tron-bike-at-last/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" hreflang="en"/><id>http://ukmac.github.io/blog/posts/2020-07-26-zwift-tron-bike-at-last/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><content type="html">
&lt;p>Yesterday was a big day on &lt;a
class="gblog-markdown__link"
href="https://zwift.com"
>Zwift&lt;/a> for me. Finally after about 18 months of rides I passed the 50,000m climbing needed to be awarded the &lt;a

&lt;p>Prior to my ride yesterday I had around 800m of climb left to do so decided what better way to knock off those last metres than to do it on &lt;a

href="https://zwiftinsider.com/massive-alpe-du-zwift-climb-released/"
>Alpe du Zwift&lt;/a>. I was about 3/4 of the way up when the notification popped onto the screen to say I had been awarded the Tron bike. As you can see from the picture I took the opportunity when I got to the top to quickly change over to my new steed for the ride down again (with suitably large smile on my face!)&lt;/p>
